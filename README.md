## 1. Artificial Neural Network
- **Repository**: https://github.com/jaderjj/First_Artifical_Neural_Network
- **Summary**: My first artificial neural network. Utilizing two hidden-layers, this ANN also has the ability to hypyertune a L2 regularization and learning rate parameter. In the examples folder I investigate a Kaggle example of classifying digits using this neural network. With 2500 iterations, it has a 98.8% accuracy on the test dataset.
