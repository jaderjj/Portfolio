## 1. Artificial Neural Network
- **Repository**: https://github.com/jaderjj/First_Artifical_Neural_Network
- **Summary**: My first artificial neural network. Utilizing two hidden-layers, this ANN also has the ability to hypyertune a L2 regularization and learning rate parameter. In the examples folder I investigate a Kaggle example of classifying digits using this neural network. With 2500 iterations, it has a 98.8% accuracy on the test dataset.

## 2. Data Mining
- **Repository:** https://github.com/jaderjj/Data_Mining_Essentials
- **Summary:** Using a synthetic dataset, I explore two methods of dimensional reduction (Principal Component Analysis and TSNE). From there, I explore methods of clustering (K-means and DBSCAN) and how to use the elbow-method for K-means to choose the optimal number of clusters for my dataset. I further explore the silhouette coefficient and show it through a graphical representaion to show how well each object has been classified.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis
- **Repository**: https://github.com/jaderjj/VADER_Sentiment_Analysis
- **Summary**: Conducted analysis on a Twitter fan community by sampling reactions and using VADER's sentiment analysis<sup>1</sup> to gain an understanding of what can cause reactions from a sample to deviate from the general population.
